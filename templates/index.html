            Court Science is a web-based platform that makes the power of data science accessible
            to basketball players, coaches, and leagues worldwide. We aim to bridge the gap
            between STEM and sports, by leveraging data science to provide basketball enthusiasts
            with key data insights including visualizations, boosting their game to the next level.
